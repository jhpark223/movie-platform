    <h2 class="article-title">5 movies to watch if you liked Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer'</h2>

        <p>"Killers of the Flower Moon"</p>
        <p>If "Oppenheimer" has you looking for something of a similar scale, then look no further than Martin Scorsese's "Killers of the Flower Moon." Leonardo DiCaprio plays Ernest Burkhart, a war veteran who is manipulated by his uncle, William King Hale (Robert De Niro), into marrying into the Osage so they can take ownership of their land and make money from the oil. It's a harrowing tale brought to life with expert precision by Scorsese. Yes, its lengthy runtime is intimidating, but this story deserves every second of it.</p>
        
        <p>"Valkyrie"</p>
        <p>Tom Cruise starred as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg in 2008's "Valkyrie," which follows several real-life German officers who attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler during World War II because of their concerns about what the dictator had planned for the country. It's a gripping thriller that shows a perspective of World War II that audiences don't typically see on the big screen.</p>
        
        <p>"Public Enemies"</p>
        <p>Everyone loves a rogue, and bank robber John Dillinger is one of the most infamous outlaws of the 20th century thanks to his crime spree in the 1930s. Michael Mann's "Public Enemies" sees Johnny Depp play the career criminal in the final few years of his life while he evaded the authorities. Christian Bale also stars in the film as Melvin Purvis, the FBI agent in charge of finding Dillinger.</p>
        
        <p>"The Social Network"</p>
        <p>David Fincher's "The Social Network" looks at the creation of one of the most influential websites of all time: Facebook. While the idea of following a group of computer programmers creating a social media site doesn't sound as sexy as other entries on the list, director David Fincher brings a sense of style and pace to Mark Zuckerberg's story that works brilliantly. Jesse Eisenberg embodies the creator with ease opposite a dedicated performance from Andrew Garfield as Facebook CFO, Eduardo Saverin.</p>
        
        <p>"Dunkirk"</p>
        <p>"Oppenheimer" marks the second time that Christopher Nolan looked at World War II, with 2017's "Dunkirk" giving audiences a visceral snapshot of what it was like for soldiers on the ground, in the air, and at sea during the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940. "Oppenheimer" star Cillian Murphy also appears in the film as a shell-shocked soldier who is pulled out of the ocean.</p>

    <h2 class="article-title">Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning: Part One</h2>
    <p class="article-author-date">Brian Tallerico - July 14, 2023</p>
    <img src="images/image1.jpg" alt="Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning: Part One" class="article-image">
    <div class="article-content">
        <p>While this series essentially rebooted in its fourth chapter, changing tone and style significantly, this seventh film very cleverly ties back to the 1996 Brian De Palma original more than any other, almost as if it's uniting the two halves of the franchise. It’s not an origin story, but it does have the tenor of something like the excellent “Casino Royale” in how it unpacks the very purpose of a beloved character. “Dead Reckoning Part One” is about Ethan Hunt reconciling how he got to this point in his life, and McQuarrie and co-writer Erik Jendresen narratively recall De Palma’s film repeatedly. And with its sweaty, canted close-ups, Fraser Taggart’s cinematography wants you to remember the first movie—how Ethan Hunt became an agent and the price he’s been paying from the beginning.</p>

        <p>It’s not just visual nods. “Dead Reckoning” returns former IMF director Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny) to Ethan’s life with a new mission. Kittridge informs Hunt that there’s essentially a rogue A.I. in the world that superpowers are battling to control. The A.I. can be manipulated with a key split into two halves. One of those halves is about to be sold on the black market, and so Ethan and his team—including returning characters Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg)—have to not just intercept the key but discern its purpose. The key only matters if IMF can figure out where and how to use it.</p>

        <p>There’s also something fascinating thematically here about a movie star battling A.I. and questioning the purpose of his job. Blockbusters have been cautionary tech tales for generations but think about the meta aspect of a spy movie in which the world could collapse if the espionage game is overtaken by a sentient computer that stars an actor who has been at the center of controversy regarding his own deepfakes. There’s also a definite edge to the plotting here that plays into the actor’s age in that Ethan is forced to answer questions about what matters to him regarding his very unusual work/life balance, a reflection of what a performer like Cruise must face as he reaches the end of an action movie rope that’s been much longer than anyone could have even optimistically expected. Cruise may or may not intend that reading—although I suspect he does—but it adds another layer to the action.</p>

        <p>Of course, the most important thing is this: “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is just incredibly fun. It feels half its length and contains enough memorable action sequences for some entire franchises. Will Cruise save the blockbuster experience again? Maybe. And he might do it again next summer too.</p>
